## Summary

Ayden Springer is a 20-year-old bilingual developer from Jacksonville, Florida, currently in his third year at UNF pursuing a Computer Science degree while simultaneously managing a portfolio of professional client work and his own SaaS business. Despite not yet having his degree, he operates at a mid-level capacity across frontend, backend, and blockchain development, has secured over $20,000 in grants and funding for clients, and maintains professional relationships that result in paid internships and strong endorsements.

His technical range spans modern web development (React/Next.js), blockchain systems (Solidity, Solana, Stacks), performance optimization (recently learned Go), AI integration, and full product development from concept to production. He recently restructured his AI pixel art business (PixelNova) under a new LLC after discovering its profitability potential, demonstrating business acumen alongside technical skills.

Living on a naval base, driving a Tesla, and balancing a 3.8 GPA with multiple income streams, Ayden represents a high-functioning young professional navigating the complexity of modern career building. His "no zero days" philosophy, rapid execution style, and reputation as a "unicorn developer" who "talks with his keyboard" distinguish him in a field where many his age are still in purely academic contexts.

He is not seeking comfort or validation but rather accurate assessment, direct feedback, and practical advancement toward his stated five-year goal of financial stability and his longer-term vision of scaling a consumer-facing technology company integrating advanced AI and UX. His trajectory suggests someone who will likely achieve these goals if he maintains current momentum and successfully navigates the transition from student to full-time professional upon graduation in Spring 2027.
